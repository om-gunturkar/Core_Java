Inner Classes in Java ðŸ§±

An inner class in Java is a class defined within another class. The enclosing class is known as the
outer class or main class. Inner classes are primarily used to enhance code readability and maintainability. A significant advantage is their ability to access members of the outer class, including private data members and methods. You can declare multiple inner classes within a main class.
